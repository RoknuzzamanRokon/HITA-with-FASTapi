# Mapping_3.py Improvements

## Overview

The `mapping_3.py` script has been significantly enhanced with better error handling, improved matching algorithms, and a more robust architecture.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Text Processing

- **Better text cleaning**: Removes special characters and normalizes whitespace
- **Improved fuzzy matching**: Multiple algorithms including substring and word-level matching
- **Case-insensitive matching**: All text comparisons are normalized

### 2. Robust API Data Extraction

- **Multiple fallback fields**: Checks various possible field names for city/country
- **Nested object support**: Handles complex API response structures
- **Type safety**: Added type hints throughout the codebase

### 3. Advanced Matching Algorithm

- **Multi-factor scoring**: Combines name, city, and country similarity
- **Dynamic weighting**: Adjusts scoring based on available data
- **Performance optimization**: Pre-filters by country when possible
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Different confidence thresholds based on data quality

### 4. Object-Oriented Architecture

- **HotelMapper class**: Encapsulates all mapping functionality
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with logging
- **Configurable timeouts**: Prevents hanging on slow API calls
- **Batch processing**: Support for mapping multiple hotels

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Debugging

- **Structured logging**: Uses Python's logging module
- **Match tracking**: Shows top candidates for debugging
- **Detailed metrics**: Confidence scores, thresholds, and candidate counts
- **Better error messages**: More informative error reporting

### 6. Additional Features

- **Batch mapping**: Process multiple hotels efficiently
- **Test framework**: Comprehensive testing of improvements
- **Flexible configuration**: Easy to modify parameters
- **Better output format**: Structured JSON with detailed metadata

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from mapping_3 import HotelMapper

mapper = HotelMapper()
result = mapper.map_hotel("agoda", "64845042")
if result:
    print(f"Found match: {result['find_hotel']['matched_data']['name']}")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from mapping_3 import batch_map_hotels

hotel_ids = ["64845042", "31563646", "12345678"]
results = batch_map_hotels("agoda", hotel_ids)
print(f"Mapped {results['summary']['successful']} out of {results['summary']['total_hotels']} hotels")
```

### Testing Different Suppliers

```python
from mapping_3 import test_different_suppliers

test_different_suppliers()  # Tests multiple supplier/hotel combinations
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Country pre-filtering**: Reduces search space significantly
- **Early termination**: Stops processing when perfect matches are found
- **Efficient text processing**: Optimized string operations
- **Memory usage**: Better handling of large CSV files

## Reliability Improvements

- **Timeout handling**: Prevents infinite waits
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing even if some steps fail
- **Input validation**: Checks for required data before processing
- **Exception recovery**: Handles various error conditions

## Configuration Options

- **CSV file path**: Configurable data source
- **API endpoints**: Easy to modify base URLs
- **Matching thresholds**: Adjustable confidence levels
- **Timeout values**: Configurable request timeouts

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all improvements:

```bash
python test_mapping_3_improvements.py
```

## Migration from Previous Versions

The new version is backward compatible but offers much better performance and reliability. Simply replace the old file and enjoy the improvements!
